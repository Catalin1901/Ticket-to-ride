# Ticket to ride
 A C console app that helps the user to find the best solution and the highest score for a given number of tracks from station A to station B

 In order to change the tickets input, go in main at ticket and add/remove/change tickets according to the mask found a couple of lines lower.
 
 In "data.txt" folder are the edges that represents the possible paths between stations. If you want to use the algorithm for other map, different from the given one, just change the data from "data.txt" keeping the same format.
 Also if there are other station names, adjust the mask array found in main.
